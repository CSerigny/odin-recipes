    <h2>Smash Burgers with Sloppy Joe Sauce. Yum!</h2>
    <p>This recipe is perfect for when you get stuck cooking the same meals and want to change it up.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1/3 cup diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Sloppy Joe sauce, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 slices thick-cut American cheese</li>
        <li>2 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil, onion, and bell pepper; season with garlic powder and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and browned around the edges, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange onion mixture into 4 mounds. Divide beef into 4 portions and place each portion over a mound of peppers and onions. Using a flat spatula, press down firmly on each section to form thin patties. Season evenly with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom and around the edges, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip burgers and top each with 2 tablespoons of Sloppy Joe sauce. Place cheese slices over two of the burgers and top with remaining 2 burgers.</li>
        <li>Toast each bun in pan drippings and add stacked burgers to buns. Serve with more sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
